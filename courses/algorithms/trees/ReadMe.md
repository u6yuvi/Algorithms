# Foundation

1. BST as Abstract Data Type 
2. BST to store heirarchial information
3. Time Complexity of Balanced Binary Tree and Non-Balanced Binary Tree 
3. Search in BST
4. Insert in BST
5. Delete in BST
6. Traversal in BST [ Pre Order, In-Order, Post-Order]
7. BST from Arrays using [Pre Order + InOrder ] or [Inorder + Post Order]
7. Balancing Binary Trees


# Problems
## BST Operations
- BST Search
- BST Insert [ Build a Tree]
- BST Predecessor and Successor
- BST Delete
    - Delete a node with no child
    - Delete a node with single child
    - Delete a node with two child nodes [ use successor strategy]

## DFS
- Preorder Traversal of a Binary Tree
- Inorder Traversal of a Binary Tree
- Postorder Traversal of a Binary Tree
## BFS
- Level Order Traversal on Binary Tree
- Level Order Traversal for N-ary tree
- Right side view of the binary tree
- Reverse Level Order Traversal
- Zig-Zag Level Orer Traversal

## Bottom Up DFS 
### PostOrder Traversal
- Diameter of the Binary Tree
- Count Univalue Subtrees
- Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor
### InOrder Traversal
- Kth Smallest Element Of BST

## Top Down DFS
- Print all paths that sum to k 
- Root To Leaf Path Sum Equal To K
- Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence[TODO]
- Path Sum II
- Path Sum III

## Tree Construction
- Convert Sorted arrays to Binary Search Tree
- Construct Binary Tree from Preorder Traversal
