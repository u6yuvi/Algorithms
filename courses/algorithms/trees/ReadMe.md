7. Balancing Binary Trees


# Problems
## BST Operations
- BST Search
- BST Insert [ Build a Tree]
- BST Predecessor and Successor
- BST Delete
    - Delete a node with no child
    - Delete a node with single child
    - Delete a node with two child nodes [ use successor strategy]

## Bottom Up DFS 
### PostOrder Traversal
- Diameter of the Binary Tree
- Count Univalue Subtrees
- Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree
- Lowest Common Ancestor
### InOrder Traversal
- Kth Smallest Element Of BST

## Top Down DFS
- Print all paths that sum to k 
- Root To Leaf Path Sum Equal To K
- Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence[TODO]
- Path Sum II
- Path Sum III

## Tree Construction
- Convert Sorted arrays to Binary Search Tree
- Construct Binary Tree from Preorder Traversal
