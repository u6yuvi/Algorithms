'''
Array
1. It can store data of specified type.
2. Elements of array are located in a contiguous block.
3. Each element of an array has a unique index.
4. The size of the array is predefined and cannot be modified. 

# Time Complexitiy

Creation of an array - Time O(1) Space- O(n)
Insertion of an element in an array. 
1. At the starting of the array - O(n) 
2. At the end of the array if array is not full - O(1)
3. At the end of the array if array is full - O(n)
4. Space complexitiy for all the above cases is O(1) 

Accessing an element by index in an array - Time -O(1) Space - O(1)
Traversing in an array - Time - O(n) - Space - O(1)
Searching for an element in an array - Time -O(n) Space - O(1)
Delection of an element in an array
1. At the end of the array - 0(1)
2. At the start or middle of the array - O(n)
3. Space complexity for all the above case - O(1)
